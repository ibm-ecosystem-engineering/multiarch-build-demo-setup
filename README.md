# OpenShift multiarchitecture build using Tekton - Demo setup

<!-- TODO Change the repo to the IBM org -->

![DevSecOps workflow](./media/multiarch-build-workflow.png)
This Terraform script is an automated setup for building multiarchitectures images using Tekton on different OpenShift clusters.

The pipelines used are under the repository : https://github.com/aminerachyd/ibm-garage-tekton-tasks/tree/multiarch-pipeline

The multiarchitecture pipelines build images for x86, IBM Z (s390x) and IBM Power (ppc64le) architectures.

This script uses a setup script to configure clusters in order to produce multiarchitecture images, then launches Tekton pipelines to build and deploy the applications using ArgoCD.

## Prerequisites :

- Install [Terraform CLI](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- Admin access to two x86 clusters, a Z cluster and a Power cluster
- One x86 cluster is used as a "development cluster", the [Cloud-Native Toolkit](https://cloudnativetoolkit.dev/) aswell as [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) should be installed on this cluster.
  You can install ArgoCD using the OpenShift operator : Red Hat OpenShift GitOps
  The other clusters will be used as "workload clusters" to build images in the corresponding architectures and deploy them later on with ArgoCD via a GitOps repository that is also being created by the script.
- [Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/advanced-cluster-management) managing the workload clusters with the [Submariner add-on](https://submariner.io) installed on them to enable inter-cluster communication.

| project-name          | Name of the project you want to create. The script will generate a project named `<project-name>-dev` on the development cluster in which you can run your pipelines.

## Deploy with Terraform

1. Clone github repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ibm-ecosystem-lab/multiarch-build-demo-setup
   ```

2. Create your `variables.tfvars` variables file

3. Deploy with terraform

   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

## Application architecture

The deployed application will be following this architecture:
![Multiarch-build-demo-architecture](./media/hybrid-multicloud-showcase.png)

The services are distributed on all the clusters and can communicate with each other using the Submariner add-on. They are deployed with a GitOps strategy, the GitOps repo is created with the script using the `github-user` and `github-token` variables. ArgoCD will try to deploy the services according to what is listed on the GitOps repo. Services placement can also be altered on ArgoCD, either before the deployment on the Terraform script or after the deployment using the ArgoCD UI/CLI.
