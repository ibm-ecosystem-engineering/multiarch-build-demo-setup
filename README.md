# OpenShift multiarchitecture build using Tekton - Demo setup

<!-- TODO Change the repo to the IBM org -->

![DevSecOps workflow](./media/multiarch-build-workflow.png)
This Terraform script is an automated setup for building multiarchitectures images using Tekton on different OpenShift clusters.

The pipelines used are under the repository : https://github.com/aminerachyd/ibm-garage-tekton-tasks/tree/multiarch-pipeline

The multiarchitecture pipelines build images for x86, IBM Z (s390x) and IBM Power (ppc64le) architectures.

This script uses a setup script to configure clusters in order to produce multiarchitecture images, then launches Tekton pipelines to build and deploy the applications using ArgoCD.

## Prerequisites :

- Install [Terraform CLI](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- Admin access to two x86 clusters, a Z cluster and a Power cluster
- One x86 cluster is used as a "development cluster", the [Cloud-Native Toolkit](https://cloudnativetoolkit.dev/) aswell as [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) should be installed on this cluster.
  You can install ArgoCD using the OpenShift operator : Red Hat OpenShift GitOps
  The other clusters will be used as "workload clusters" to build images in the corresponding architectures and deploy them later on with ArgoCD via a GitOps repository that is also being created by the script.

| project-name          | Name of the project you want to create. The script will generate a project named `<project-name>-dev` on the development cluster in which you can run your pipelines.
